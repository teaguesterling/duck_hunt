## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Load Duck Hunt Extension**:
   ```sql
   LOAD 'build/release/extension/duck_hunt/duck_hunt.duckdb_extension';
   ```

2. **Run Your First Analysis**:
   ```sql
   -- Get basic error pattern overview
   SELECT 
       root_cause_category,
       COUNT(*) as occurrences,
       COUNT(DISTINCT pattern_id) as unique_patterns
   FROM read_test_results('workspace/**/*.txt', 'auto')
   WHERE root_cause_category IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY root_cause_category
   ORDER BY occurrences DESC;
   ```

3. **Explore Advanced Analytics**:
   - Copy queries from the `analytics/` directory
   - Modify file patterns to match your data structure
   - Combine queries for comprehensive analysis

## üìä Available Analytics

### üïí Temporal Analysis (`analytics/temporal_analysis.sql`)

**What it does**: Analyzes how error patterns evolve over time
- **Error Frequency Trends**: Track increases/decreases in specific errors
- **Cyclical Pattern Detection**: Find errors that occur on regular schedules
- **Pattern Evolution**: How error characteristics change over time
- **Root Cause Trending**: Which types of errors are becoming more/less common

**Use Cases**:
- Predict when maintenance windows should be scheduled
- Identify recurring issues that need permanent fixes
- Track the effectiveness of fixes over time
- Plan capacity based on error cycles

**Example Output**:
```
error_date    | pattern_id | daily_trend | weekly_trend_status | z_score
2024-01-15    | 42         | INCREASING  | SPIKE              | 2.1
2024-01-14    | 23         | STABLE      | NORMAL             | 0.3
```

### üîó Failure Correlation (`analytics/failure_correlation.sql`)

**What it does**: Discovers relationships between different error types
- **Co-occurrence Analysis**: Errors that happen together
- **Failure Cascades**: Errors that trigger other errors
- **Cross-Environment Propagation**: How errors spread between dev/staging/prod
- **Root Cause Correlation Matrix**: Which error types are related

**Use Cases**:
- Identify root causes that affect multiple systems
- Prevent cascade failures by fixing trigger issues
- Understand environment-specific vs. systemic problems
- Plan fixes based on error relationships

**Example Output**:
```
pattern_a | pattern_b | correlation_strength | likely_relationship
42        | 87        | 0.85                | LIKELY_SAME_ROOT_CAUSE
23        | 91        | 0.73                | CASCADE_EFFECT
```

### üîÆ Predictive Analytics (`analytics/predictive_analytics.sql`)

**What it does**: Predicts future failures and assesses risks
- **Error Recurrence Prediction**: When specific errors will likely reoccur
- **Environment Risk Assessment**: Which environments are most risky
- **Deployment Readiness**: Whether it's safe to deploy
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual patterns that need investigation

**Use Cases**:
- Schedule preventive maintenance before errors occur
- Make deployment go/no-go decisions
- Allocate monitoring resources to high-risk areas
- Get early warning of emerging issues

**Example Output**:
```
pattern_id | predicted_next_median | prediction_confidence | urgency_level | recommendation
42         | 147                  | HIGH                  | IMMINENT      | CRITICAL_WATCH
87         | 152                  | MEDIUM                | NEAR_TERM     | MONITOR_CLOSELY
```

### üìä Dashboard Queries (`dashboards/error_overview.sql`)

**What it does**: Provides executive-level summary metrics
- **KPI Overview**: Failure rates, unique patterns, system health
- **Top Issues**: Most frequent errors requiring attention
- **Environment Health**: Comparative analysis across environments
- **Trend Analysis**: Recent vs. historical performance
- **Tool Performance**: Which tools are working well vs. poorly

**Use Cases**:
- Executive dashboards and reports
- Daily operational health checks
- SLA monitoring and reporting
- Team performance metrics

**Example Output**:
```
dashboard_section        | total_events | failure_rate_pct | health_status
System Health Overview   | 1,247        | 8.3             | üü° Warning
Environment Comparison   | -            | -               | -
```

## üéØ Advanced Use Cases

### 1. **Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
Combine temporal analysis with predictive analytics:
```sql
-- Find patterns that occur cyclically and predict next occurrence
WITH cyclical_errors AS (
    SELECT * FROM (temporal_analysis_query) WHERE cycle_type = 'WEEKLY'
),
predictions AS (
    SELECT * FROM (predictive_analytics_query) WHERE prediction_confidence = 'HIGH'
)
SELECT c.pattern_id, c.avg_interval_hours, p.predicted_next_median
FROM cyclical_errors c
JOIN predictions p ON c.pattern_id = p.pattern_id
ORDER BY p.predicted_next_median;
```

### 2. **Release Risk Assessment**
Combine correlation analysis with environment health:
```sql
-- Assess deployment risk based on recent error patterns and correlations
WITH high_risk_patterns AS (
    SELECT * FROM (correlation_analysis_query) WHERE correlation_strength >= 0.7
),
environment_health AS (
    SELECT * FROM (dashboard_query) WHERE health_status LIKE '%Critical%'
)
-- Join and analyze for deployment decision
```

### 3. **Root Cause Investigation**
Chain multiple analyses for comprehensive investigation:
```sql
-- Start with frequent patterns, find correlations, predict impact
WITH frequent_errors AS (
    SELECT pattern_id FROM (dashboard_query) ORDER BY occurrences DESC LIMIT 10
),
correlations AS (
    SELECT * FROM (correlation_query) WHERE pattern_a IN (SELECT pattern_id FROM frequent_errors)
),
predictions AS (
    SELECT * FROM (prediction_query) WHERE pattern_id IN (SELECT pattern_a FROM correlations)
)
-- Comprehensive root cause analysis
```

## üõ† Customization Guide

### Adapting File Patterns
Replace `'workspace/**/*.txt'` with your actual file patterns:
```sql
-- Examples for different directory structures
read_test_results('logs/ci-cd/**/*.json', 'auto')           -- CI/CD logs
read_test_results('results/*/test-output.xml', 'auto')     -- XML test results  
read_test_results('builds/{2024,2023}/**/*.log', 'auto')   -- Yearly organization
```

### Time Window Adjustments
Modify time calculations for your timeline:
```sql
-- Adjust the 70/30 split for recent vs. historical
WHERE file_index >= (SELECT MAX(file_index) * 0.8 FROM ...)  -- More recent data
WHERE file_index <= (SELECT MAX(file_index) * 0.5 FROM ...)  -- More historical data
```

### Threshold Tuning
Customize alert thresholds for your environment:
```sql
-- Adjust risk thresholds
WHEN failure_rate_pct >= 15 THEN 'CRITICAL'    -- Lower threshold for sensitive systems
WHEN correlation_strength >= 0.6 THEN 'STRONG' -- Different correlation sensitivity
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For Large Datasets
1. **Use LIMIT clauses** in exploratory queries
2. **Create materialized views** for frequently-used aggregations
3. **Add WHERE clauses** to focus on specific time periods or patterns
4. **Use SAMPLE** for development with large datasets

### Query Optimization Tips
```sql
-- Good: Filter early and use indexes
SELECT * FROM read_test_results('data/**/*.txt', 'auto')
WHERE pattern_id IS NOT NULL AND status IN ('ERROR', 'FAIL')
LIMIT 1000;

-- Better: Focus on specific patterns or time periods
SELECT * FROM read_test_results('data/**/*.txt', 'auto')
WHERE file_index >= 100 AND root_cause_category = 'network';
```

## üîß Integration Examples

### With BI Tools (Tableau, PowerBI, Grafana)
```sql
-- Create views for BI tool consumption
CREATE VIEW error_kpis AS
SELECT * FROM (dashboard_overview_query);

CREATE VIEW pattern_trends AS  
SELECT * FROM (temporal_analysis_query);
```

### With Alerting Systems
```sql
-- Find critical issues for alerting
SELECT pattern_id, recommendation, urgency_level
FROM (predictive_analytics_query)
WHERE recommendation = 'CRITICAL_WATCH'
  AND urgency_level = 'IMMINENT';
```

### With CI/CD Pipelines
```sql
-- Deployment readiness check
SELECT readiness_status, deployment_recommendation
FROM (deployment_readiness_query)
WHERE target_environment = 'prod';
```
